# ðŸš† Train Complaint Management System

A responsive, interactive web application designed to improve the experience of lodging complaints related to train services. This project showcases a well-structured complaint form, intuitive UI/UX, and unique image hover effects that visually enhance user interaction.

##  Features

- Complaint form with real-time validation (Name, Email, Phone, PNR)
-  Option to upload images as evidence
-  Alert system for invalid or incomplete fields
-  Smooth form show/hide toggling
- Scroll-to-top functionality
- **Unique hover effect**: Images seamlessly transition to alternate views on hover with a **5-second fade-in effect**
-  Clean UI layout with sectioned design for better content flow

##  Unique Hover Effect

This project features a custom image hover effect that reveals a new image with a **gradual 5-second fade-in transition**:

```css
.hover-image {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    opacity: 0;
    transition: opacity 5s ease;
    z-index: 2;
}
.image-container:hover .hover-image {
    opacity: 1;
}
.image-container:hover .normal-image {
    opacity: 0;
}
```

This effect is ideal for showing "before and after" comparisons, enhanced visuals, or interactive storytelling in image galleries.
